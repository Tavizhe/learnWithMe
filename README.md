# learnWithMe

## Playing around GitHub

alright so in order to commit anything in git we do these steps:

1. install `https://github.com/cli/cli/releases` cli for github.
2. clone the repository that we are working with with this command: `gh repo clone Tavizhe/learnWithMe`.
3. make the change you want to do in your files.
4. go to Source control and click on changed file.
5. then click on + to stage the changes.
6. add commit massage about what you did or to ignore it add #.
7. press tick.
8. and last press button to Sync changes to git.
