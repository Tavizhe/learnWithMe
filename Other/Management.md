## Managing a Business

Being successful as a business owner requires more than coming up with a brilliant idea and working hard

### Know your business

It seems obvious, but its worth mentioning:

### Know the basics of business management

You might be able to start a business on the basis of a great idea, but to manage it you need to understand the functional areas of ==business—accounting, finance, management, marketing, and production==. You need to be a salesperson, as well as a decision maker and a planner.

<div class="farsi rounded border border-dark border-2 pe-2 text-center">
<p>ایده ما برای زدن شرکت این بود که پول بیشتری در بیاریم و با توجه به قیمت های بسیار بالا موقعیت خوبی دیدیم که با دادن قیمت پایین تر و گرفتن کار بیشتر از بقیه جلو بزنیم.

لازمه برای مدیریت کسب و کارمون حساب داری و سرمایه گذاری و مدیریت کلی و بازاریابی و در کنار این مورد قدرت هدایت به هدف جدید و توانایی برنامه ریزی رو هم داشته باشیم.

### Have the proper attitude.

When you own a business, you are the business. If you’re going to devote the time and energy needed to transform an idea into a successful venture, you need to have a passion for your work. You should believe in what you’re doing and make a strong personal commitment to your business.

<div class="farsi rounded border border-dark border-2 pe-2 text-center">
<p>
لازمه کارمان اینه که ریسک کنیم، وقت و انرژی بزاریم، اشتیاق داشته باشیم به کاری که داریم میکنیم. اعتماد به نفس داشته باشیم و برای انجام کارمون تعهد شخصی قرار داده باشیم.
</p>

</div>

### Get adequate funding

It takes a lot of money to start a business and guide it through the start-up phase (which can last for over a year). You can have the most brilliant idea in the world, the best marketing approach, and a talented management team, yet if you run out of cash, your career as a business owner could be brief. Plan for the long term and work with lenders and investors to ensure that you’ll have sufficient funds to get open, stay open during the start-up phase, and, ultimately, expand.

## Manage your time efficiently

A new business owner can expect to work sixty hours a week. If you want to grow a business and have some type of none work life at the same time, you’ll have to give up some control—to let others take over some of the work. Thus, you must develop time-management skills and learn how to delegate responsibility.

<div class="farsi rounded border border-dark border-2 pe-2 text-center">

## Know how to manage people

Hiring, keeping, and managing good people are crucial to business success. As your business grows, you’ll depend more on your employees. You need to develop a positive working relationship with them, train them properly, and motivate them to provide quality goods or services.

<div class="farsi rounded border border-dark border-2 pe-2 text-center">

### Satisfy your customers

You might attract customers through impressive advertising campaigns, but you’ll keep them only by providing quality goods or services. Commit yourself to satisfying—or even exceeding—customer needs.

### Know how to compete

Find your niche in the marketplace, keep an eye on your competitors, and be prepared to react to changes in the marketplace. The history of business (and much of life) can be summed up in three words: “Adapt or perish.”

## How to fail

- **Bad business idea.** - Like any idea, a business idea can be flawed, either in the conception or in the execution. If you tried selling snowblowers in Hawaii, you could count on little competition, but you’d still be doomed to failure.

- **Cash problems.** - Too many new businesses are underfunded. The owner borrows enough money to set up the business but doesn’t have enough extra cash to operate during the start-up phase, when very little money is coming in but a lot is going out.
- **Managerial inexperience or incompetence.** - Many new business owners have no experience in running a business; many have limited management skills. Maybe an owner knows how to make or market a product but doesn’t know how to manage people. Maybe an owner can’t attract and keep talented employees. Maybe an owner has poor leadership skills and isn’t willing to plan ahead.
- **Lack of customer focus.** - A major advantage of a small business is the ability to provide special attention to customers. But some small businesses fail to seize this advantage. Perhaps the owner doesn’t anticipate customers’ needs or keep up with changing markets or the customer-focused practices of competitors.
- **Inability to handle growth.** - You’d think that a sales increase would be a good thing. Often it is, of course, but sometimes it can be a major problem. When a company grows, the owner’s role changes. He or she needs to delegate work to others and build a business structure that can handle the increase in volume. Some owners don’t make the transition and find themselves overwhelmed. Things don’t get done, customers become unhappy, and expansion actually damages the company.

## Help from the SBA (Small Business Administration)

Here’s how the SBA’s loan guaranty program works: You apply to a bank for financing. A loan officer decides if the bank will loan you the money without an SBA guarantee. If the answer is no (because of some weakness in your application), the bank then decides if it will loan you the money if the SBA guarantees the loan. If the bank decides to do this, you get the money and make payments on the loan.

The Small Business Development Center (SBDC) assists current and prospective small business owners with business problems and provides free training and technical information on all aspects of small business management.

EXPLORING BUSINESS

# Chapter 1: The Foundations of Business

## 1.2 Getting Down to Business

- The main participants in a business are its owners, employees, and customers.
- Businesses are influenced by such external factors as the economy, government, consumer trends, and public pressure to act as good corporate citizens.

<div class="farsi rounded border border-dark border-2 text-center">

==Identify the main participants of business==, the functions that most businesses perform, and the external forces that influence business activities.

</div>

A business is any activity that provides goods or services to consumers for the purpose of making a profit.The activities needed to operate a business can be divided into a number of functional areas: management, operations, marketing, accounting, and finance. Let’s briefly explore each of these areas.

### Management

**Managers** are responsible for the work performance of other people. Management involves planning for, organizing, staffing, directing, and controlling a company’s resources so that it can achieve its goals.

### Operations

The person who designs and oversees the transformation of resources into goods or services is called an **operations manager**. All companies must convert resources (labor, materials, money, information, and so forth) into goods or services.

### Marketing

Marketing consists of everything that a company does to identify customers’ needs and designs products to meet those needs. Marketers develop the benefits and features of products, including price and quality. They also decide on the best method of delivering products and the best means of promoting them to attract and keep customers. They manage relationships with customers and make them aware of the organization’s desire and ability to satisfy their needs.

### Accounting

Managers need accurate, relevant, timely financial information, and accountants provide it. **Accountants** measure, summarize, and communicate financial and managerial information and advise other managers on financial matters.

### Finance

Finance involves planning for, obtaining, and managing a company’s funds. Finance managers address such questions as the following: How much money does the company need? How and where will it get the necessary money?

## 1.3 What Is Economics?

<div class="rounded border border-dark border-2 ">

- Define economics and identify factors of production.
- Explain how economists answer the three key economics questions.
- Compare and contrast economic systems.

</div>

### Resources: Inputs and Outputs

==**Economics** is the study of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services==. **Resources** are the inputs used to produce outputs. Resources may include any or all of the following:

- Land and other natural resources
- Labor (physical and mental)
- Capital, including buildings and equipment
- Entrepreneurship (is the creation or extraction of economic value)

Land and natural resources provide the needed raw materials. Labor transforms raw materials into goods and services. Capital (equipment, buildings, vehicles, cash, and so forth) are needed for the production process. Entrepreneurship provides the skill and creativity needed to bring the other resources together to produce a good or service to be sold to the marketplace.

### Input and Output Markets

- Households not only provide factors of production (or resources) but also consume goods and services.
- Businesses not only buy resources but also produce and sell both goods and services.

![](https://open.lib.umn.edu/app/uploads/sites/15/2015/04/5476dabfb73e108459cf1d1aa2e7bc7f1.jpg)

#### The Questions Economists Ask

deserve a highlight.

1. What goods and services should be produced to meet consumers’ needs? In what quantity? When should they be produced?
2. How should goods and services be produced? Who should produce them, and what resources, including technology, should be combined to produce them?
3. Who should receive the goods and services produced? How should they be allocated among consumers?

#### Free Market System

The economic system in which most businesses are owned and operated by individuals is the free market system, also known as **capitalism**. As we will see next, in a free market, competition dictates how goods and services will be allocated. Business is conducted with only limited government involvement. The economies of the United States and other countries, such as Japan, are based on capitalism.

## 1.4 Perfect Competition and Supply and Demand

<div class="rounded border border-dark border-2 ">
Describe perfect competition, and explain how supply and demand interact to set prices in a free market system.
</div>

Economists have identified four types of competition—perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly.

### Perfect Competition

Perfect competition exists when there are many consumers buying a standardized product from numerous small businesses. Because no seller is big enough or influential enough to affect price, sellers and buyers accept the going price.
For example, when a commercial fisher brings his fish to the local market, he has little control over the price he gets and must accept the going market price.
In a market characterized by perfect competition, price is determined through the mechanisms of supply and demand. Prices are influenced both by the supply of products from sellers and by the demand for products by buyers.
in **demand**: is the quantity of a product that buyers are willing to purchase at various prices. in **supply**: is the quantity of a product that sellers are willing to sell at various prices. in the middle of these two curved lines there is **Equilibrium Price** at which both buyers and sellers are satisfied.

## 1.5 Monopolistic Competition, Oligopoly, and Monopoly

<div class="rounded border border-dark border-2 ">
Describe monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly.
</div>

### Monopolistic Competition

In monopolistic competition, we still have many sellers (as we had under perfect competition). Now, however, they don’t sell identical products. Instead, they sell differentiated products—products that differ somewhat, or are perceived to differ, even though they serve a similar purpose. Products can be differentiated in a number of ways, including quality, style, convenience, location, and brand name.

### Oligopoly

Oligopoly means few sellers. In an oligopolistic market, each seller supplies a large portion of all the products sold in the marketplace.
Companies in oligopolistic industries include such large-scale enterprises as automobile companies and airlines.

### Monopoly

In a monopoly, however, there’s only one seller in the market. The market could be a geographical area, such as a city or a regional area, and doesn’t necessarily have to be an entire country.

**Natural monopolies** include public utilities, such as electricity and gas suppliers. They inhibit competition, but they’re legal because they’re important to society.
**A legal monopoly** arises when a company receives a patent giving it exclusive use of an invented product or process for a limited time, generally twenty years.

## 1.6 Measuring the Health of the Economy

<div class="rounded border border-dark border-2 ">
Understand the criteria used to assess the status of the economy.
</div>

You need to have some idea of where the economy is heading, and you need to know something about the government’s role in influencing its direction.

All the world’s economies share three main goals:

- Growth - One way in which economists measure the performance of an economy is by looking at a widely used measure of total output called **gross domestic product** (GDP). GDP is defined as the market value of all goods and services produced by the economy in a given year. (If GDP (after adjusting for inflation) goes up, the economy is growing. If it goes down, the economy is contracting.)
- High employment - To keep the economy going strong, people must spend money on goods and services. A reduction in personal expenditures for things like food, clothing, appliances, automobiles, housing, and medical care could severely reduce GDP and weaken the economy. Because most people earn their spending money by working, an important goal of all economies is making jobs available to everyone who wants one.
- Price stability - A third major goal of all economies is maintaining price stability. Price stability occurs when the average of the prices for goods and services either doesn’t change or changes very little. Rising prices are troublesome for both individuals and businesses. For individuals, rising prices mean you have to pay more for the things you need. For businesses, rising prices mean higher costs, and, at least in the short run, businesses might have trouble passing on higher costs to consumers.

When the overall price level goes up, we have **inflation**. The most widely publicized measure of inflation is the **consumer price index** (CPI), which is reported monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

## 1.7 Government’s Role in Managing the Economy

<div class="rounded border border-dark border-2 ">
Discuss the government’s role in managing the economy.
</div>

In every country, the government takes steps to help the economy achieve the goals of growth, full employment, and price stability. Through **monetary policy**, the government exerts its power to regulate the money supply and level of interest rates. Through **fiscal policy**, it uses its power to tax and to spend.

### Monetary Policy

Monetary policy is exercised by the Federal Reserve System (“the Fed”), which is empowered to take various actions that decrease or increase the money supply and raise or lower short-term interest rates, making it harder or easier to borrow money. When the Fed believes that inflation is a problem, it will use concretionary policy to decrease the money supply and raise interest rates. When rates are higher, borrowers have to pay more for the money they borrow, and banks are more selective in making loans. Because money is “tighter”—more expensive to borrow—demand for goods and services will go down, and so will prices. In any case, that’s the theory.

### Fiscal Policy

Fiscal policy relies on the government’s powers of spending and taxation. Both taxation and government spending can be used to reduce or increase the total supply of money in the economy—the total amount, in other words, that businesses and consumers have to spend.
When the economy is experiencing inflation, the opposite policy is adopted: the government will decrease spending or increase taxes, or both. Because such concretionary measures reduce spending by businesses and consumers, prices come down and inflation eases.
