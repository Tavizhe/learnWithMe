# Managing a Business

Being successful as a business owner requires more than coming up with a brilliant idea and working hard

## Know your business

It seems obvious, but its worth mentioning:

- successful business people know what they are doing.
- They are knowledgeable about the industry in which they operate (both as it stands today and where its headed).
- they know who their competitors are.
- They know how to attract customers and who the best suppliers and distributors are.
- they understand the impact of technology on their business

## Know the basics of business management

You might be able to start a business on the basis of a great idea, but to manage it you need to understand the functional areas of ==business—accounting, finance, management, marketing, and production==. You need to be a salesperson, as well as a decision maker and a planner.

<p>ایده ما برای زدن شرکت این بود که پول بیشتری در بیاریم و با توجه به قیمت های بسیار بالا موقعیت خوبی دیدیم که با دادن قیمت پایین تر و گرفتن کار بیشتر از بقیه جلو بزنیم.
<br>
لازمه برای مدیریت کسب و کارمون حساب داری و سرمایه گذاری و مدیریت کلی و بازاریابی و در کنار این مورد قدرت هدایت به هدف جدید و توانایی برنامه ریزی رو هم داشته باشیم.

## Have the proper attitude.

When you own a business, you are the business. If you’re going to devote the time and energy needed to transform an idea into a successful venture, you need to have a passion for your work. You should believe in what you’re doing and make a strong personal commitment to your business.

<div class="farsi rounded border border-dark border-2 pe-2 text-center">

لازمه کارمان اینه که ریسک کنیم، وقت و انرژی بزاریم، اشتیاق داشته باشیم به کاری که داریم میکنیم. اعتماد به نفس داشته باشیم و برای انجام کارمون تعهد شخصی قرار داده باشیم.

## Get adequate funding

It takes a lot of money to start a business and guide it through the start-up phase (which can last for over a year). You can have the most brilliant idea in the world, the best marketing approach, and a talented management team, yet if you run out of cash, your career as a business owner could be brief. Plan for the long term and work with lenders and investors to ensure that you’ll have sufficient funds to get open, stay open during the start-up phase, and, ultimately, expand.

## Manage your time efficiently

A new business owner can expect to work sixty hours a week. If you want to grow a business and have some type of none work life at the same time, you’ll have to give up some control—to let others take over some of the work. Thus, you must develop time-management skills and learn how to delegate responsibility.

## Know how to manage people

Hiring, keeping, and managing good people are crucial to business success. As your business grows, you’ll depend more on your employees. You need to develop a positive working relationship with them, train them properly, and motivate them to provide quality goods or services.

## Satisfy your customers

You might attract customers through impressive advertising campaigns, but you’ll keep them only by providing quality goods or services. Commit yourself to satisfying—or even exceeding—customer needs.

## Know how to compete

Find your niche in the marketplace, keep an eye on your competitors, and be prepared to react to changes in the marketplace. The history of business (and much of life) can be summed up in three words: “Adapt or perish.”

# How to fail

- **Bad business idea.** - Like any idea, a business idea can be flawed, either in the conception or in the execution. If you tried selling snowblowers in Hawaii, you could count on little competition, but you’d still be doomed to failure.

- **Cash problems.** - Too many new businesses are underfunded. The owner borrows enough money to set up the business but doesn’t have enough extra cash to operate during the start-up phase, when very little money is coming in but a lot is going out.
- **Managerial inexperience or incompetence.** - Many new business owners have no experience in running a business; many have limited management skills. Maybe an owner knows how to make or market a product but doesn’t know how to manage people. Maybe an owner can’t attract and keep talented employees. Maybe an owner has poor leadership skills and isn’t willing to plan ahead.
- **Lack of customer focus.** - A major advantage of a small business is the ability to provide special attention to customers. But some small businesses fail to seize this advantage. Perhaps the owner doesn’t anticipate customers’ needs or keep up with changing markets or the customer-focused practices of competitors.
- **Inability to handle growth.** - You’d think that a sales increase would be a good thing. Often it is, of course, but sometimes it can be a major problem. When a company grows, the owner’s role changes. He or she needs to delegate work to others and build a business structure that can handle the increase in volume. Some owners don’t make the transition and find themselves overwhelmed. Things don’t get done, customers become unhappy, and expansion actually damages the company.

# Help from the SBA (Small Business Administration)

Here’s how the SBA’s loan guaranty program works: You apply to a bank for financing. A loan officer decides if the bank will loan you the money without an SBA guarantee. If the answer is no (because of some weakness in your application), the bank then decides if it will loan you the money if the SBA guarantees the loan. If the bank decides to do this, you get the money and make payments on the loan.

The Small Business Development Center (SBDC) assists current and prospective small business owners with business problems and provides free training and technical information on all aspects of small business management.
